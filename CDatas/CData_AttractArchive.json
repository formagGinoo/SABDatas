Only this time, there were no cool fingers to ease the scorching heat.\n\nThe Brennholt title was not just a reward—it was also a tool to maintain the heartbeat of the Divine Body and suppress the \"War\" of the Apocalypse. When Agares won his arena battle and received this surname, he was destined to become a sacrifice for the Divine Body.\n\nAs the flames tore through his flesh, I seemed to glimpse their true nature: it wasn't the heat of the Divine Body I felt, but the burning of countless vows to survive. Within each vow, a different face flickered—his, the princess's, and the countless Brennholts, long since turned to bleached bones.\n\nSuddenly, the crackling of his charred skin jolted me from my thoughts. Only then did I realize—I was still in his grip. 'Some promises... not even fire can burn away.'\"",
