Experiment #12.\nSubject: Survivor of the Ganelon family clash.\nCondition: Human-like appearance with partial black coarse hair; abnormal tailbone growth observed. Pupils constricted, highly sensitive to light and water. Presumably in the mid-to-late stages of Black Blood disease.\nCondition of Blood: Blood separated through layering process, darker than average in hue, composition of red blood cells only 10%.\nExperiment Record: Blood transfusion slowed the spread of the Black Blood but eventually proved ineffective and was abandoned. A new mixture of Pure Blood extracted from Pure Blood Essence and combined with a sample of Black Blood from a Bloodborn (Cain) was injected into the neck, chest, and legs. The body was then stored in a wooden coffin in the cellar for seven days.\nResults: The subject reverted to human form, with the Black Blood fully suppressed after further refinement of the blood. The seventh, ninth, and eleventh experiments confirmed the Pure Blood Essence's suppressive effect, but the subject's native Black Blood could not merge with Bloodborn fluids. Dissection revealed swollen organs, abnormal bone growth, and Black Blood clots encasing red blood. The subject ultimately succumbed to Black Blood disease. Experiment failed.\n— Baphomet\"",

The remaining four showed no abnormalities.\nAfter the second dose, with Silver Blood this time, a woman who did not have Black Blood disease and a male heretic died from excessive hemorrhaging, accompanied by severe convulsions and incontinence. The remaining two survived, though the female heretic experienced hair loss and molting of the skin.\nAfter the third dose, once again with Silver Blood, a man who did not have Black Blood disease bled from eyes, nose, and ears, then died from a sudden rise in body temperature. The female heretic, despite her earlier symptoms, rapidly recovered and revealed a 'divine mark' on her hand.\nUpon examination, her blood had turned a semi-transparent silver, free of Black Blood, and she retained her consciousness and memories. Moreover, she inherited the memories of an individual known as 'Darcias.'\nMay the martyrs return to Aeon.\nAn esteemed Bell Ringer will administer the next trial for the Silver Blood successor.\"",
