But how could I find something that was never truly there?\n'Are you... Darcias?'\nA voice from behind stopped me in my tracks, and its owner stepped into view. 'Could you help me with something?'\n'Help?'\n'I want you to help me find the voice deep within your soul.'\"",

It's all pretty straightforward. But humans are much more complex. Each person is unique, and even knowing their environment doesn't always help to predict their behavior or nature. Humans are more intricate than animals, and animals are more complex than plants. Initially, I found this complexity overwhelming, but I've adapted over time. I believe your view of humans might be a bit too simplistic. Treating people like plants can lead to misunderstandings or extreme conclusions.

Rarely did he spend his days at home.\nThis book delves into his childhood, chronicling how his family's territory faced repeated encroachments and how Florent, using master military strategy, navigated numerous challenges on his journey to becoming the heir apparent. Against all odds, he ascended to the throne, wielding his formidable sword and fleet to dominate the isles and establish himself as the undisputed ruler of the region. His undefeated reputation eventually garnered attention from nations across the continent and the Church, despite his kingdom's remoteness in the Northwest.\n—Prologue to The Chronicles of the Lionheart King\"",
